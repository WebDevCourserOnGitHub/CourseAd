      <section>
          <div class="lng-proposition">
            For all those who have permission to work in the United States, are over 18 years of age
            and feel capable of passing the Department of Health exam in English,
            I offer you the opportunity to obtain the profession of nursing assistant
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="lng-think-twice-about-english">
            After completing the course, you will need to pass an exam in English
            at the Department of Health within two weeks (the exam cannot be postponed,
            so think initially about your level of conversational English)
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="lng-how-many-days">
            The course lasts 22 days, of which 14 days are theory and the rest practical
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="lng-internship-saslary">
            Attention! Practice pays! They will pay you for it;
            for working during the internship in the hospital, you will receive a salary
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="lng-reimbursed">
            That is, for your work in practice in the hospital,
            you will practically be reimbursed for the cost of the course
          </div>
          <div class="lng-course-cost">
            The cost of the course is $2000, plus $230 tax upon registration
          </div>
          <div class="lng-split-payment-title">
            There are two options to pay for the course (not including taxes):
          </div>
          <div class="lng-split-payment-first-option">
            1. You can divide the $2000 into 4 payments, but you must pay them all at the end
            of the theoretical part of the course, that is, on the 13th day from the start of the course
          </div>
          <div class="lng-split-payment-second-option">
            2. You can split the $2000 into 2 payments, with the second being made after you are hired
            at the hospital where the internship will take place (i.e. this option is only valid for those
            who decide to work at that hospital for the first few years)
          </div>
          <div class="lng-demanded-doc-title">
            You will have direct contact with the doctor who will conduct the training
            and prepare you for the exam at the Department of Health, as soon as you send me
            copies of your required documents:
          </div>
          <div class="lng-demanded-doc-work-permit">

            If you have it, you can bring it immediately, and if not, you can get it just before the course starts, since we have our own service for it
